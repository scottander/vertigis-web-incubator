# Esri 3d Widget Components

Esri's JavaScript 4.x API contains a series of ready-to-use UI widgets. Included in this library are some of Esri's 3d widgets wrapped in a VertiGIS Studio Web component and ready to use.

The [AreaMeasurement component](src\components\AreaMeasurement\AreaMeasurement.tsx) initializes Esri's [AreaMeasurement3D JavaScript widget](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-widgets-AreaMeasurement3D.html) and acts as a wrapper so it can be placed anywhere in a VertiGIS Studio Web application.

The [Daylight component](src\components\Daylight\Daylight.tsx) initializes Esri's [Daylight JavaScript widget](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-widgets-Daylight.html) and acts as a wrapper so it can be placed anywhere in a VertiGIS Studio Web application.

The [ElevationProfile component](src\components\ElevationProfile\ElevationProfile.tsx) initializes Esri's [ElevationProfile JavaScript widget](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-widgets-ElevationProfile.html) and acts as a wrapper so it can be placed anywhere in a VertiGIS Studio Web application.

The [LineOfSight component](src\components\LineOfSight\LineOfSight.tsx) initializes Esri's [LineOfSight JavaScript widget](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-widgets-LineOfSight.html) and acts as a wrapper so it can be placed anywhere in a VertiGIS Studio Web application.

The [ShadowCast component](src\components\ShadowCast\ShadowCast.tsx) initializes Esri's [ShadowCast JavaScript widget](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-widgets-ShadowCast.html) and acts as a wrapper so it can be placed anywhere in a VertiGIS Studio Web application.

The [Slice component](src\components\Slice\Slice.tsx) initializes Esri's [Slice JavaScript widget](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-widgets-Slice.html) and acts as a wrapper so it can be placed anywhere in a VertiGIS Studio Web application.

The VertiGIS Studio Map component in the sample instantiates a sample VertiGIS Studio Web application with the included 3D component pre-configured.
